### README for session.el: Session Management for Emacs

## X-URL: http://emacs-session.sourceforge.net/


When you start Emacs, package Session restores various variables (e.g.,
input histories) from your last session.  It also provides a menu
containing recently changed/visited files and restores the places (e.g.,
point) of such a file when you revisit it.


Changes 2.4b vs 2.4a:
 * Emacs would sometimes try to open a remote connection when using the
   menus.

Changes 2.4a vs 2.4:
 * With Emacs before 24.4, (eval-after-load 'session FORM) would
   have FORM evaluated before package session has been loaded.

Changes 2.4 vs 2.3a:
 * Do not write text properties of strings into session file,
   as they might be unreadable in the next Emacs session.
 * Make session correctly save rings.
 * Make session better interact with package anything.
 * Miscellaneous.

Changes 2.3a vs 2.3:
 * Make session better interact with org-mode.

Changes 2.3 vs 2.2a:
 * Bug fix: Saving the session file would infloop due to
   variables with recursive values (often in rings).
 * Bug fix: Exiting Emacs might have failed due to buffers
   visiting remote files with lost connections.
 * Use Emacs user directory for session save file.
 * Installation now works via customization.
 * Improve file menus.
 * Miscellaneous.

Changes 2.2a vs 2.2:
 * Miscellaneous.

Changes 2.2 vs 2.1c:
 * Improve "jump to the position of the last change", now
   jumps successively to change positions by repeated
   invocation of the command.  Better computation of undo
   positions.

Changes 2.1c vs 2.1b:
 * Save session file as private file.
 * Use same sequence for the new two File submenus on Emacs
   and XEmacs, the XEmacs one was the intended one.

Changes 2.1b vs 2.1a:
 * Make sure that the user is always asked whether to exit
   if the session file could not be written.

Notes 2.1a:
 * Change should fix bug "no such submenu: edit".

Changes 2.1a vs 2.1:
 * Bug fix: on XEmacs, Initialization would fail without
   menus "File" and "Edit" in menubar.
 * Minor bug fixes.  Miscellaneous.

Changes 2.1 vs 1.5a:
 * Moved to SourceForge.net.  Less technical description on
   web page.
 * Menus and keybindings work with Emacs-21, too.  Rename
   submenus.
 * Minor bug fixes.  Miscellaneous.

Notes 2.1:
 * Previous project home page was:
      http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/session/

Changes 1.5a vs 1.5:
 * Bug fix: set coding-system to avoid corrupted multi-byte
   strings.
 * Bug fix: don't activate mark in Emacs, always set point.
 * Bug workaround: disable `interprogram-paste-function' of
   XEmacs in menu.
 * New command to show history of minibuffer input and to
   toggle permanent flag.
 * Miscellaneous improvements.
